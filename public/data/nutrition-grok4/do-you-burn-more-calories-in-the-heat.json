    {
      "q": "Do you burn more calories in the heat during exercise?",
      "a": "Yes, typically 5-15% more due to increased cardiovascular strain and sweating."
    },
    {
      "q": "How much extra calories does heat add to workouts?",
      "a": "About 30-50 extra kcal per hour for moderate exercise, depending on temperature and humidity."

    {
      "q": "Does heat affect resting calorie burn?",
      "a": "Slightly; basal metabolic rate may rise 5-10% in hot environments from thermoregulation."

    {
      "q": "Is it safe to exercise in the heat for more calorie burn?",
      "a": "Possible but risky; hydrate well, monitor for heat exhaustion, and acclimate gradually."

    {
      "q": "Why do you burn more calories in hot weather?",
      "a": "Body expends energy cooling itself via sweat and higher heart rate to maintain core temperature."
